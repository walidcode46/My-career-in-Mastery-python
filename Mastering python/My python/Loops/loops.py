# Loops Example: Printing Numbers from 1 to 5
# This program demonstrates two types of loops in Python: a for loop and a while loop.
# The for loop iterates over a range of numbers from 1 to 5 and prints each number.
# The while loop initializes a counter at 1 and continues to print the counter value
# until the counter exceeds 5, incrementing the counter by 1 in each iteration.
# --------------------------------------------------------

print("1")
print("2")
print("3")
print("4")
print("5")

counter = 1         # Initialize counter
while counter <= 5: # Loop until counter is greater than 5
    print(counter)  # Print the current counter value
    counter += 1    # Increment counter by 1
print("Finished")   # Print finished message
